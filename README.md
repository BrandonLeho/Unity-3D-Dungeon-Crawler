### Repo created

Just a repo that has the scripting for a dungeon crawler game that I have no idea if it'll ever be finished.

**Prototype of the Prototype**

- Have the basic implementation of what I want combat to be like.

- Artstyle I have right looks nice. I could definitely see myself keeping this for a while.

- I've got a basic enemy AI down. I really want expand it to a scope that's probably way too much for me, but I'm just going to work on one thing at a time and not look at the scope.

- Couldn't resist to add guns because of my last [Unity 2D project](https://github.com/BrandonLeho/2D-Dungeon-Crawler) where I had a decent amount of gun options that were highly modular.

- Thinking about calling this game DREADNAUTS which was the name of my last project that only got to prototype phase.

I know I'm in the honeymoon stage of development right now. I just hope I can see this through. Anyways here's some footage of some gameplay:
