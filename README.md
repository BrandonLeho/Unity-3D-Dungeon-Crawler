### Repo created

Just a repo that has the scripting for a dungeon crawler game that I have no idea if it'll ever be finished.

**Prototype of the Prototype**

- Have the basic implementation of what I want combat to be like.

- Artstyle I have right looks nice. I could definitely see myself keeping this for a while.

- I've got a basic enemy AI down. I really want expand it to a scope that's probably way too much for me, but I'm just going to work on one thing at a time and not look at the scope.

- Couldn't resist to add guns because of my last [Unity 2D project](https://github.com/BrandonLeho/2D-Dungeon-Crawler) where I had a decent amount of gun options that were highly modular.

- Thinking about calling this game DREADNAUTS which was the name of my last project that only got to prototype phase.

I know I'm in the honeymoon stage of development right now. I just hope I can see this through. Anyways here's some footage of some gameplay:

I know there are more video tutorials I watched but I can't remember them all. I'll probably not list anymore video tutorials from here on out. These are just the first tutorials that got the ball rolling for me on this project.

**You can definitely tell these animations were made by a solo dev**

- I added a temporary SWAT model from Mixamo for the player character just so I can get some basic prodeural animations on the player.

- Figured out a way to rig the arms and hands to display the equipment. Might change that later down the line. It works fine now, but if it gives me problems later I'll probably just end scrapping the whole procedural animation and just go with baked animations.

- I think the walking animation looks a bit goofy, but there could be some charm to that. I don't plan on changing it unless I get an outside opinion absolutely destroying me for it, but I don't see that happening.

- Official deemed the name of the project as DREADNAUTS. It would be a waste of a good name if I didn't use it. Thank you to my friend for coming up with the name.
